# go-hello-world

## Overview
This is just a simple program written in go which I can use for reference later on

## How to build
1. Set your GOPATH environment variable
    ```console
    export GOPATH=<path to where the project is located>
    ```
2. Use the go command to build the executable
    ```console
    go install hello
    ```
3. The executable named "hello" should now be located in the bin directory
